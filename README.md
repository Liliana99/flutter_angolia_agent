# flutter_Agent

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The goal was to design a consumer-facing, non-conversational experience where search relevance, data structure, and performance drive the user experience — instead of chat-based flows. This project demonstrates hands-on work with: • Flutter Web • Algolia Search (indexing, searchable attributes, relevance tuning) • Product-oriented search UX • Real-time, low-latency data retrieval.

- Happy to discuss how search, data quality, and UX intersect in real-world product development.
